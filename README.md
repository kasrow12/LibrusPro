## ⭐️ • Custom events in the schedule
Want to add your own event to your schedule? Planned midterms, oral answers or maybe homework you don't want to forget? With this extension it is finally possible!

## ⭐️ • Calculating grade point average
Some schools disable the ability to display grade point average. If they don't want Librus to count it, your computer will count it instead. In the table you will find, respectively, the average for the semester, for the proposed grades, for the mid-term grades, and for all the partial grades (annual average).

## ⭐️ • Hiding subjects without grades
Why should they even display if you don't get a single grade out of them all year?

## ⭐️ • Displaying your number from the journal
Can't ever remember which number you have in your diary? From now on, it will always appear at the top of the page next to "Lucky Number" so you never forget it again.

## ⭐️ • Descriptions of events in the schedule
Why hover over each item in your schedule to read its description? From now on you will find them directly on them, without having to hover!

## ⭐️ • Depression Mode
Subdued colors for grades and schedule events when you are not feeling well. Depression mode can be enabled in the extension options menu.

## ⭐️ • Visual improvements
- option to disable the display of ones in the extension menu,
- information when you have a "lucky number",
- displaying the proposed behavior in the main table,
- removing the alternative version button, because who the hell needs it anyway,
- removing the "Bezpieczny Uczeń" button in schools where it is enabled,
- removing unnecessary buttons from the navigation bar (Surveys, Library),
- adding a Lesson Plan button instead, which opens in new tab instead of window
