Fortunately, this is no longer a problem :)

![Dark theme 1](docs/LibrusPro_home.png?raw=true)
![Dark theme 2](docs/LibrusPro_absence.png?raw=true)
![Dark theme 3](docs/LibrusPro_messages.png?raw=true)

## • Custom events in the schedule
Want to add an event to your schedule? With this extension it's finally possible!

## • Hiding subjects without grades
Why should they even display if you don't get a single grade out of them all year?

## • Visual improvements
Display the proposed behavior in the main table, remove unnecessary buttons from the navigation bar (Surveys, Library) and add a&nbsp;Lesson Plan button instead. Also adding event descriptions in the schedule with no need to hover over them to read.
