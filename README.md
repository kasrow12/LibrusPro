## • Custom events in the schedule
Want to add an event to your schedule? With this extension it's finally possible!

## • Calculating grade point average
Some schools disable the ability to display grade point average. If they don't want Librus to count it, your computer will count it instead.

## • Hiding subjects without grades
Why should they even display if you don't get a single grade out of them all year?

## • Visual improvements
- displaying the proposed behavior in the main table,
- removing unnecessary buttons from the navigation bar (Surveys, Library),
- adding a Lesson Plan button instead,
- adding event descriptions in the schedule with no need to hover over them to read,
- information about your number from the journal next to the Lucky Number and information when it will be yours!
